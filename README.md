# lectin methods
The analysis is based on background substraction, noise removal and automated thresholding segmentation method. Export the different channels of the fluorescent images to two different folders, isolectin B4 and WGA stained respectively in a root folder named by the experimental group. While you run the script, you only need to open the first picture of ILB4 folder. During the run, you can visually observe the segmentation results with colored overlay masks. At the end, you get your results’ arrays opened in a new window in ImageJ, and exported to comma separated csv file named by your „main folder_CapillaryDensity.csv” next to your root folder. The preset parameters (scaling, thresholding, size and circularity) we published in the script were suitable for all of our samples photographed with 20X objective. The careful adjustment of values might be needed for other experimental setups.
